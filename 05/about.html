    <p>
      <strong><em>Hello</em></strong> <br /><br />
      I will be graduating in 2025 with an Engineering Degree in
      <em>Information Technology</em> from
      <abbr title="Krishna Institue of Engineering and Technology">KIET</abbr>
      Group of Institutions. My Schooling is from Kendriya Vidyalaya. Iâ€™ve
      relevant experience implementing various machine learning and deep
      learning algorithms for prediction purposes. <br /><br />
      I recently completed a project using a
      <abbr title="convolutional neural network">CNN</abbr> architecture to
      predict tumours from brain MRI images. where I used a dataset of brain
      <abbr title="Magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr> images, some of which
      had tumours and others did not. I trained the model to distinguish between
      "tumour" and "non-tumor" images based on their features.<br /><br />
      Another project I worked on was stock price prediction using long
      short-term memory (LSTM) networks. I used Yahoo Finance API to collect
      historical stock data for a specific company and used it to train and test
      a machine learning model.<br /><br />
      My main interest is in Learning new technologies, Solving problems,
      Building useful applications, and Collaborating with others.
      <br /><br />On these projects I learned about the trade-offs between
      different evaluation metrics and how to effectively fine-tune a machine
      learning model. Overall, these project was a valuable learning experience
      that helped me improve my skills in machine learning.<br /><br />
      I wish and am working to expand my knowledge of
      <em>machine learning</em> and <em>cloud technologies.</em> Learning about
      machine learning gives me the skills and knowledge I need to create
      innovative solutions to real-world problems and have a positive impact on
      society. Cloud technologies, on the other hand, will also be useful for
      building and deploying machine learning models at scale.<br /><br />
      I am very adaptable and enjoy learning new things. I can quickly grasp new
      concepts and apply them effectively in a variety of situations. This is
      one of my greatest strengths, as it allows me to easily adapt to new
      environments and challenges. <br /><br />My leisure activities include a
      diverse range of interests and hobbies. Watching self-improvement videos
      and spending time with friends and family are two of my favourite things
      to do in my spare time.
      <u>I believe that a healthy balance of work and leisure is essential, and
        I make an effort to devote time to activities that bring me joy and
        relaxation.</u><br /><br />
      <em>Thank You!</em><br />
